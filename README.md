Absorbing phase transitions and self-organisation in granular suspensions

In this work, absorbing state phase transitions in athermal granular suspensions sheared at low Reynolds
number are explored using numerical simulations. The system is only able to self-organise into an absorbing
state if the strain amplitude is below a critical value 
c, which is strongly dependent on concentration.
Two considerably different types of absorbing states are observed at concentrations above and below the
critical jamming volume fraction. At low concentrations, hydrodynamics dominates and the equations
of motion are time-reversible, offering a clear route to reversibility. At high concentrations, contact forces
dominate and the equations of motion are irreversible. However, at low strain amplitudes, the particles are
able to self-organise towards an absorbing state. Microscopic and macroscopic reversibility are considered
in an attempt to characterise the transition, and a phase diagram indicating regions in which both types
of reversibility are satisfied is constructed. A critical volume fraction at which absorbing states cannot be
formed, even for infinitesimally small strain amplitudes, is identified as the jamming point and estimated to
be \phi_c = 0.650 \pm 0.004. Good agreement is found between microscopic and macroscopic reversibility criteria
for suspensions at concentrations below the jamming point, but inconsistency at concentrations above the
jamming point prevents unication of both types of absorbing-state transitions.
